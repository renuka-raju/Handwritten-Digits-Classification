# Handwritten-Digits-Classification

You will use logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit
recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes). On mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. This exercise will show you how the methods you've learned can be used for this classification task.
In the first part of the exercise, you will extend your previous implementation of logistic regression and apply it to one-vs-all classification

1. One Vs All Classification
2. Neural networks feed forward propogation
